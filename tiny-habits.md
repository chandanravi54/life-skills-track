<h2>Your takeaways from the video(Tiny Habit)</h2>

* Starting a tiny step is important to achieve the goal. Many people think the goal is far away, and looks hard. Then they imagine they still have a long way to the goal. But the key is just to start a tiny step.
* It is much easier to do "Baby Steps" to get the big goal, than jumping straight to the goal and falling back into the old habit.
* tiny habit repeated over a long time helps us build it as an everyday habit without much effort. Will apply this method to form new habits
* This is great. I know it works. But we have to put effort into maintaining the habit.
* This is extraordinary insight...simple yet so powerful!<br>

<h2>Your takeaways from the video in as much detail as possible</h2>

BJ Fogg suggests shrinking every new habit to the tiniest possible version, so you don’t need to rely on motivation. You can find the tiniest version of your desired habit by either reducing the quantity or doing just the first step. 

For example:
1. The tiniest version of a sixty‐minute meditation practice is a one-breath meditation.
2. The tiniest version of a daily planning routine is writing down one to‐do item on an index card and putting the index card in your pocket.
3. Your goal is to find a behavior that you can easily do in thirty seconds or less.

There are three types of habit prompts (habit reminders):<br>
1. External/context prompts cues from your environment like post‐it notes, phone notifications, and alarms.
2. Internal prompts (also known as personal prompts): thoughts and sensations that remind you to act, like a grumbling stomach.
3. Action prompts: the completion of one behavior reminds you to start the next behavior. Loading the dishwasher can be a prompt to clean the kitchen countertop.<br>
“When you feel successful at something, even if it’s tiny, your confidence grows quickly, and your motivation increases to do that habit again and perform related behaviors. I call this success momentum. Surprisingly enough, this gets created by the frequency of your successes, not by the size...You that can resist learning to celebrate (small completions), but be aware that you’re choosing not to be as good as you could be at creating habits. For most people, the effort of learning to celebrate is a small price to pay for becoming a Habit Ninja.” – BJ Fogg
  
<h2>How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier?</h2>

Behavior is the result of motivation, ability, and prompts taken at the same time. This is a simple formula that can lead to incredible results. In other words, a behavior is a result of:
Motivation, or your desire to execute the behavior.
Ability, i.e. your capacity to execute the behavior.
Prompt, or your cue to execute the behavior.
This is true for building a habit and breaking an old habit in equal measure. <br>

<h2>Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?</h2>

As said by someone, it doesn’t take 21 days to wire in a habit, says psychologist BJ Fogg. Sometimes, all you need is a shot of positive feeling and emotion, a dose of celebration. Celebrating is a great way to reinforce small changes and pave the way for big successes.<br>

<h2>Write about the book's perspective on making a bad habit more difficult?</h2>

It's tough to do this. In a sense, parts of our brains are working against us when we try to overcome bad habits. “These routines can become hardwired in our brains,” Volkow says. And the brain's reward centers keep us craving the things we're trying so hard to resist.
<h2>

Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?</h2>

One habit I just want to apply in my daily life is "Early to be, early to rise".
Because the early morning hours are a time for peaceful reflection and ample productivity, when the world is still asleep, allowing you to focus wholeheartedly on your long-term goals. Anyone serious about success in any measure knows that it's important to wake up early.
Even if you're not a morning person, use incremental changes in your daily routine to start waking up earlier and earlier. Begin by setting your alarm clock back by 15 minutes the first week, 15 minutes the next week, and so on. Do this until you can wake up at least two hours earlier than you're waking up now.

<h2>Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?</h2><br>
