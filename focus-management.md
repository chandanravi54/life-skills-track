## 1. What is Deep Work?

* Deep work is the concept of having the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It acts like a superpower in our increasingly competitive twenty-first-century economy.<br>
* The ability to quickly master hard things and the ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed, are two core abilities for thriving in today’s economy.<br>

## 2. Paraphrase all the ideas in the above videos and this one in detail.
### Optimal duration for deep work

As Newport puts it “the ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.”
While we fully recommend reading the book in its entirety, this guide distills all of the research and recommendations into a single actionable resource that you can reference again and again as you build your deep work practice. You’ll learn how to integrate deep work into your life to execute at a higher level and discover the rewards that come with regularly losing yourself in meaningful work.

### Are deadlines good for productivity?

Deadlines are periods that create the structure for crazy hours at the end of the timeline to get it all in a release because “we are expected to do it”, followed by a recovery period where productivity completely crashes. It’s why the founding father of Agile methodology Kent Beck describes overtime as “borrowing from the future”.<br>

### Summary of Deep Work Book

The summary of the Deep Work Book can be elaborated as It proposes that we have lost our ability to focus deeply and immerse ourselves in a complex task, showing you how to cultivate this skill again and focus more than ever before with four simple rules.
Deep Work Strategies  
1. Schedule and restrict distractions. 
2. Develop a rhythmic deep work ritual (Transform deep work into a daily habit)  
3. Have a daily shutdown ritual (Prepare for the next day)

## 3. How can you implement the principles in your day-to-day life?

1. Concentrate on your needs.</b>
2. Schedule and restrict distractions  
3. Make it a habit - Schedule it in (1hrs)  
4. Daily shutdown ritual - Schedule next day
Identify your needs, level, and ability— if you take your work life as an example, what stage are you at? What experience do you have? What’s possible for you? Note this down. Once you know this, it’s much easier to know if what you’re doing is specific to your needs.<br>
Ask yourself, “is it specific to you?” — you don’t want to be caught up in something irrelevant to you. Question yourself to ensure that what you’re doing is right for you.<br>

2. Progressive Overload<br>
* Volunteer for different things <br>
* Take very small steps<br>
* Don’t be afraid to take risks<br>

3. Rest and Recovery<br>
Adaptations and growth occur during recovery and rest phases in your training cycle. The same goes for your personal life too. When you take time to rest, chill out and relax, when it’s time to get going again<br>

## 4. Key takeaways from the video:-
### Dangers of Social Media

* <b>Addiction:</b> When you’re playing a game or accomplishing a task, you seek to do it as well as you can. Once you succeed, your brain will give you a dose of dopamine and other happiness hormones, making you happy. The same mechanism functions when you post a picture to Instagram or Facebook.<br> 
* <b>Sharing too much</b>: The more time spent on social media to share can lead to social anxiety, depression, and exposure to content that is not age appropriate.<br>
* <b>Cyberbullying:</b> Bullying using digital technology .The presence of strangers who may be there to 'groom' other members.<br>
* <b>Online vs Reality:</b> Social media itself is not the problem. It is the way people use it in place of actual communication and in-person socializing. “Friends” on social media may not be friends, and may even be strangers.<br>
* <b>Self-image issues:</b> Social media sites provide tools that allow people to earn others’ approval for their appearance and the possibility to compare themselves to others. It can be associated with body image concerns. <br>
