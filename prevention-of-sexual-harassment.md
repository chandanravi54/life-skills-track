## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?  
  
As a bystander or witness to harassment, I can play an essential role in supporting the person targeted by harassment. The following tools can be used when I witness harassment in a variety of settings, including sexual harassment in the workplace.  
  
Direct: If you feel that directly addressing harassment is safe and may be effective, you can confront the harasser and call out the behavior at the moment. Let them know you find their behavior inappropriate, intimidating, or hostile, and ask them to stop. This approach may escalate the situation, so consider whether you and the person being harassed are safe and whether you believe the person being harassed wants someone to speak up.<br>  
  
Distract: You can stop an incident by simply interrupting it. Rather than focusing on the aggressor or action, this subtler intervention allows you to engage the person being targeted through a distraction – ask a question, start an unrelated conversation, physically interrupt the incident or find a reason to call the person out of that space.<br>  
  
Delegate: Find an appropriate third party to intervene, such as a supervisor, human resources officer, security officer, or another colleague.<br>  
  
Delay: If I am not able or choose not to intervene at the moment, you can still support the person who has been harassed by following up with them afterward.<br>  
I can offer acknowledgment and empathy and can ask whether they need additional support, resources, or documentation of the incident. I can also confront the harasser later and let them know that I found their behavior inappropriate.<br>  
  
Document: Depending on the circumstances and whether other interventions are more urgent, it may be most helpful to document what I am witnessing. If can record an incident or jot down details, be sure to follow up with the targeted individual and ask them what they would like done with the documentation; do not share it without their consent.<br>  
  
Report the harassment  
People who experience harassment and bystanders who witness it have the right to report it. Remember that the individual who experiences harassment should ultimately decide whether they want the incident to be reported, and they may have valid reasons for not wanting to take action – such as fear of retaliation.<br>  
  
Promote equity and respect in your workplace, and be an ally to someone being harassed.

Follow the established procedures and provide them with all relevant information and evidence you have gathered.  
  
5. Seek legal advice: If the harassment persists or the response from your organization is inadequate, consult with a lawyer or seek advice from a legal service provider specializing in employment or harassment law.
