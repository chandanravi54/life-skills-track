# Listening and Active Communication  
  
### What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?  
  
1. Avoid getting distracted by your thoughts. Focus on the speaker and topic instead.

4. Show that you are listening with body language.  
5. If appropriate take notes during important conversations.  
6. Paraphrase what others have said to make sure you are both on the same page.  
  
## 2. Reflective Listening  
### According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?  

How empathy is not natural to people since judging is more common, one should become learn this skill not to become a therapist but to ace your life and your surroundings.  
Fisher’s model is a development model consisting of four stages. An accord is emerging within a group by going through these stages.  
  
1. Orientation -The first step is about getting to know each other. Here members feel uncomfortable due to a lack of communication. The group tends to experience primary tension. Interpretation and agreement happen in this phase as part of getting to know each other.  
2. Conflict - In this stage, the problem is examined and each individual tries to convey get a solution through their perspective. In small group communication, this type of response increases the individual’s participation and the group's thinking can be avoided. A high level of individuality can be sustained.  
3. Emergence - The group’s task and its arrangement become noticeable. In this stage uncertainty increases but the responses are kept quiet. The group tends to reach unanimity apart from debating with different responses in the conflicting stage.  
4. Reinforcement -This is the final stage of small group communication. Here the members try to observe their final decision through an array of their viewpoints.  
  
## 3. Reflection  
### What are the obstacles in your listening process?  
  
I feel like not focusing too much on what people speaking about any topic and I will be in my world while listening. Sometimes I can't get what they are saying and stuck when they ask the question in writing. Even I don't pretend to them as I am listening to them.  
  
### What can you do to improve your listening?  

When you are listening to someone talk, you should avoid looking out a window, texting or scrolling through your phone, or scanning a computer screen. Limit any unnecessary distractions, provide the speaker with your undivided attention, and make an effort to look at them. Try to conjure up mental images of what the speaker is talking about while you are listening to help retain information. This may be a literal picture or other concepts that relate to the topic. You may not understand everything someone says to you. It is best to wait until they pause to ask them to back up and provide clarification for the topic or phrase you misunderstood.  
  
### When do you switch to a Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?  
  
Whenever someone talks badly about me in front of me which is even not correct, yet I did not get into communication for what is he saying wrong. I still keep mum and do not respond to him. I wanted to get into that conversation but my mind feels like just leaving it.  
  
### When do you switch to Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?  
  
When I am talking about more important things with my friends but they do not listen to my word, at that of time I goes aggressively on my friends.
Another situation is when I am sharing the most important emotions with my best friend, and he is not listening to my words kindoff hurts me, so then at that of time anger comes from somewhere else I don't know.  
  
### When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day-to-day life?  
  
Till now seriously not done that kind of communication, more I feel others' emotions are very much important when getting closer or being in bonding with someone. I always talk politely with whoever it is. But sometimes I talk with my friend like that to crack a joke.  
  
### How can you make your communication assertive? You can analyze the videos and then think about what steps you can apply in your own life.  
Assertive communication is not hurting the feeling of others by expressing our thought and feeling. I follow assertive communication in my communication every day. Because my mind feels others thoughts and feelings are the same as ours. So, I always followed assertive communication knowing or without knowing. In sharing our feeling or thoughts it is very much important to more polite and honest. Then only the other person in front of me feels comfortable and follows our communication perfectly. when we are sharing an opinion about a person it is more important to talk in assertive communication. So, a person who takes our opinion seriously will feel very much comfortable listening to and accepting opinions about him.
